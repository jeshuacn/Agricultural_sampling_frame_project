<span style ="font-size:20px;">**The Goal**</span> of this project is to evaluate a target population using various sampling techniques to determine the most suitable approach for future surveys.

**We are going to use the following sampling methods:**

1- Simple Random Sampling

2- Systematic Sampling

3- Replicated Sampling

4- Probability Proportional to Size Sampling

5- Stratified Sampling


This is very important because the method you decide to use will be implemented multiple times by the data collection team whenever they're on the field and we need to capture the whole agricultural situation of the concerned region.

## The Data

The data consist of 606 farmers specialized in growing vegetables. It was gathered from surveys by the Ministry of Agriculture.
