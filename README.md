<span style ="font-size:20px;">**The Goal**</span> of this project is to evaluate a target population using various sampling techniques to determine the most suitable approach for future surveys.

**We are going to use the following sampling methods:**

1- Simple Random Sampling

2- Systematic Sampling

3- Replicated Sampling

4- Probability Proportional to Size Sampling

5- Stratified Sampling


This is very important because the method you decide to use will be implemented multiple times by the data collection team whenever they're on the field and we need to capture the whole agricultural situation of the concerned region.

## The Data

The data consist of 606 farmers specialized in growing vegetables. It was gathered from surveys by the Ministry of Agriculture.

The Dataset contains 6 variables, among which 5 are categorical (qualitative) and 1 is numerical (quantitative):

Production mode:

Primary: The same crop is planted year after year
In succession: A different crop is planted each year (or each cycle)
In association: Multiple crops are planted on the same field at the same time
Understory: Crop is planted under trees (Can be in a forest)
Irrigation:

Yes: The farmer uses a water source besides rain
No: The farmer is strictly relying on rain (Pluvial or Rainfed Irrigation mode)
Irrigation mode:

Localized: Farmer uses a drip irrigation system (continuous drops of water). This method is the most efficient in terms of water usage.
Gravity: An open air canal linking the field to the water source (eg. river). This irrigation system uses a lot of water, especially since much of it is lost through land absorption on the way and evaporation.
Aspersion: Water is brought to the plants in the form of artificial rain using sprinklers fixed across the field.
Pivot: A mobile system that pumps water from a source to a long tube with sprinklers in the sky that crosses the entire field. This sky tube moves from one side to the other and irrigates the whole field.
Gravity, Localized: Mixed
Localized, Pivot: Mixed
Crop:

Tomatoes
Potatoes
...
Greenhouse:

No: Not used
Small tunel: A tunnel that's small in width but high in length
Big Tunel: A tunnel that's high in width but small in length
Canarian: A structure made of only wires and films
Multi-chapel: Greenhouse with more than one chapel (curve)
Field area:

Planted field area in Ha (Hectares)
